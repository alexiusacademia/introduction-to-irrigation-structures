# Diversion Structures

- Diversion structures are used on surface water sources like rivers.

- They are used for diverting portion of the water flowing on a stream for use in irrigation.

- Water on a stream or river cannot be diverted 100%.

## Types of Diversion Structure

1. Run-off-the-river

    - Diversion dam

    - Intake type

    - Pump

2. Impounding

    - Earth/Rock Fill type

    - Concrete Type

## 1. Run-Off-The-River

- Directly diverts the water

## 1.1 Diversion Dam

### Pros

- Increase water level

- Stablize the river bed

### Cons

- Tedious calculations for the designer

- Formation of afflux effect

- Tendency to flood upstream areas

## 1.2 Intake Type

Used when there is no need to increase the water elevation in the stream.

### Pros

- Will not cause flooding in the upstream area

- Lesser cost than intakes with diversion dam

### Cons

- We cannot maximize the extraction of water from a river

- Stabilization of riverbed not guaranteed (Side intakes)

- Sometimes there is zero inflow

## 1.3 Pumping

### Pros

- No need for any obstruction structure most of the time

- Less expensive if using solar powered systems

### Cons

- Usually expensive for some farmers/users

## 2. Impounding Dam

### Pros

- Stores water during the rainy season

- Can be used for flood control

- Most likely could be integrated with multiple purposes

### Cons

- Necessity for bigger fundings

## Sample Multi Purpose Dams

### 1. Magat Dam
