# Conveyance Structures

- Makes the delivery of water to downstream possible.

- Brings water from the source and directly or indirectly, to farmlands.

## Diversion Conduit

- Diversion conduits are either circular or rectangular pipes that goes from an intake structure to open channels or canals.

- Diversion conduits can be treated as closed conduits or open channels (as long as there is a gap between water surface and top of conduit)

## Channel | Canal | Flume

- Channel or sometimes called canals are also referred to us as open channel.

## Inverted Siphon

Both inverted siphon and elevated flume are used in conveying water across a depression.

Inverted siphon principle is the same as that of p-trap in plumbing (opposite of siphon effect).

## Elevated Flume

- Elevated flumes are simply flumes or canals that crosses a depression.

- The normal design of an elevated flume is open channel.

- Sometimes, there is a need for an elevated flume to be treated as closed conduit (si-flume).
